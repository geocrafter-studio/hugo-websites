# METEO (Navigator Digital TestBed)

## Timeline: Q2 2024 - Q3 2024

We were honoured to participate by direct invitation from [Navigator](https://thenavigatorcompany.com/) to join the Navigator Digital TestBed.

The project we participated was named METEO and focused on developing a prototype to query, ingest and visualize a 3rd party API regarding tree plantation scoring prediction.

With this opportunity we managed to further invest on the development of our flagship product [SCALARGIS](https://github.com/scalargis). 

This was the final result of this project [METEO](http://nvg-meteo.westeurope.cloudapp.azure.com/mapa/meteo).
